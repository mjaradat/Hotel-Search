In this assignment I have used NodeJS to complete the task that were shared by Expedia.
Why NodeJS?

1- My main development experience is in JS and frontend, so I chose NodeJS for backend because it is fit my experience.
2- Node.js is an event based, asynchronous I/O framework that uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.

During my work on this assignment I got new knowledge in heroku, which is a useful utility for deploying and hosting NodeJS applications.

What I accomplished and assumptions:
1- I assumed that the destination, check-in, and check-out fields are required.
2- I assumed that the minimum value of rating is 1 and the maximum is 5.
3- I add the max guest rating and max star rating fields to the form. and we can add more fields as mentioned in the assignment link.
4- I have did a javascript validation and a server side validation to protect the service in case someone disabled the javascript validation from the browser.


Note:
- Most of technologies used in this task I learned them during task period like express framework and handlebars templating engine
